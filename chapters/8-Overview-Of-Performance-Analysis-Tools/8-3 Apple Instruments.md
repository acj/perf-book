## Apple Xcode Instruments


Instruments is an application performance analyzer and visualizer, integrated in Xcode.

The easiest way to get the profiler is to install Xcode from the Apple AppStore.

Instruments shows a time line displaying any event occurring in the application, such as CPU activity variation, memory allocation, and network and file activity, together with graphs and statistics.

### What you can do with it: {.unlisted .unnumbered}

Built-in instruments can track

- CPU activity of processes and threads.[2]
- Memory allocation and release,[3] garbage collection and memory leaks.[4]
- File reads, writes, locks.[5]
- Network activity and traffic.[6] This instrument works like Activity Monitor but also stores the data for future reference.
- Graphics and inner workings of OpenGL[7] and Metal.[8]
- Energy diagnostics and "dead" objects.[9]
- UI automation and Core animation.
- User events, such as keyboard keys pressed and mouse moves and clicks with exact time.
