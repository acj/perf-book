## Questions and Exercises {.unlisted .unnumbered}

1. Solve `perf-ninja::data_packing` lab assignment, in which you need to make the data structure more compact.
2. Solve `perf-ninja::swmem_prefetch_1` lab assignment by implementing explicit memory prefetching for future loop iterations.
3. Solve `perf-ninja::huge_pages_1` lab assignment using methods we discussed in [@sec:secDTLB]. Observe any changes in performance, huge page allocation in `/proc/meminfo`, and CPU performance counters that measure DTLB loads and misses.
4. Describe what it takes for a piece of code to be cache-friendly?
5. Run the application that you're working with on a daily basis. Measure its memory footprint, profile and identify hot memory accesses. Are they cache-friendly? Is there a way to improve them?
